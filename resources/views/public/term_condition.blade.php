<div>4.8 BOOK APPOINTMENT AND CALL FACILITY</div>

<div>For all terms and conditions of Book facility on ”aasanilaz”, Book Standards is applicable along with other Terms & Conditions.</div>
<div>“aasanilaz” aims to offer an exceptional experience to both users (users refer to patients in the document as per “aasanilaz” Terms & Conditions) and healthcare practitioners. As a valuable partner on our platform we want to ensure that the practitioners’ experience on the “aasanilaz” booking platform is seamless to both, them and their users.</div>
<div>Guidelines to enable you to deliver a great experience to patients booking appointments with you via “aasanilaz” website/app, we request all practitioners to follow the below:</div>
<div>1. Ensure that the patient consults the same practitioner with whom the appointment has been confirmed within 2 hrs of the scheduled appointment time. If due to practitioner’s unavailability this is not possible, then the appointment should be cancelled or rescheduled to another time beforehand.</div>
<div>2. Communicate to the patient about any expected delay/cancellation at least 2 hours prior to the scheduled time of appointment.</div>
<div>3. Update the practitioner’s “aasanilaz” Profile and calendar in following cases:</div>
<div>* Any scheduled closure* of the clinic/hospital, e.g. on festivals; and, blocking calendar* on personal holidays</div>
<div>* Transfer of resident/consulting practitioners to another establishment*</div>
<div>* Change in practitioner or clinic/hospital’s consultation timings*</div>
<div>*The features to perform these are available on “aasanilaz” Web. For details on these, please feel free to reach out to us at admin@aasanilaz.online</div>
<br>
<div>Exceptions to the Guidelines<div>
<div>We completely understand and respect the complexity of the medical profession, and therefore consider following exceptions (where a healthcare practitioner was unable to follow the above guidelines):</div>
<div>1. In case of personal or medical emergencies, we understand that doctor substitution, doctor no-show, last minute cancellation/rescheduling is unavoidable. In such instances, on discretion, a one-time exception for non-compliance will be made.</div>
<div>2. In case the patient is consulted by another practitioner followed by the one with whom the appointment was booked, then it is not considered as non-compliance.</div>
<div>3. In case patient’s wait time exceeds 2 hours, non-compliance is assigned on a case-by-case basis.</div>
<div>4. In case the practitioner doesn’t practice anymore at the clinic, where appointment has been booked, the clinic owner/doctor must update the information.</div>
<div>Non-compliance to the Guidelines</div>
<div>Non-compliance cases are kept in record as and when reported to “aasanilaz” via users. All such cases are verified by our team with both, the practitioner and the user. Each inbound and verified non-compliance case received by “aasanilaz”, will be communicated to the practitioner (clinic/hospital and doctor) in following ways -</div>
<div>1. Email and/or SMS at the doctor and practice registered email ID and mobile number.</div>
<div>2. Book Standards dashboard for all practices and doctors on Book facility.</div>
<div>Non-compliance cases lead to poor patient experience and may have a negative impact on the reputation of the practice, therefore “aasanilaz” may in such instances deactivate the ‘Book’ facility from “aasanilaz” profile for allowing the practitioner to become well-versed with the guidelines and become comfortable with using the features associated with it. However, while the Book facility is deactivated, the patients would still be able to connect with the practitioner or clinic/hospital through the ‘Call’ facility.</div>
<div>Doctor’s Book facility will be deactivated to avoid poor patient experience for minimum 20 days, followed by training course completion.</div>
<div>Note</div>
<div>1. All numbers in the table above are computed on a practitioner-clinic/hospital combination.</div>
<div>2. The number of non-compliance cases are calculated after excluding exceptions mentioned in “Exceptions to the Guidelines”</div>
<div>Restoring the Book facility</div>
<div>In the rare instance of the Book facility being deactivated, reinstatement and has to be initiated by the practitioners after the minimum deactivation period ends. Below are the ways practitioners or clinic/hospital owner can restore Book facility</div>
<div>1. “aasanilaz” will send an email and SMS while deactivating the Book facility. It will have link to the complete the training course. Once you complete the course, please reach out to “aasanilaz” support at admin@aasailaz.online to activate Book again.</div>
